Note to gear admin/owner
The config files in this dir are not actually actively used unless 
the rsyslogctl.sh script is edited in the master embedded cartridge
location. 

Logs are located in /tmp/ along with a socket for application logs to use: 
/tmp/log  

Test this with the logger command: 
logger -d -u /tmp/log "hello world" 

FOR REMOTE LOGGING TO AN EXTERNAL HOST: 
There are two options for remote logging 
either open an rsyslogd remote logging port on the local machine, 
and configure the remote host line in the rsyslog.conf file located
in this directory to 127.0.0.1:514 (this assumes that your openshift node 
runs a log parser/agent) 
or export the logs straight from the gear itself by adding an alternative 
network address in the remote syslog server for the gear. 

For your application you may want to create a sym-link to the required directory
in app-root for the logging socket: /tmp/log 

When you remove the rsyslogd configuration the cartridge is disabled from the gear
but the logs are left in place. 

Otherwise you are on your own :)
